Filming participants:
Planned on filming participants but didn't want to be filmed, the filming environment for the acting students didn't work because I had to hold the laptop as there were no tables and I didn't bring a tripod

Knowing what to explore:
More specific interview questions, the first few should've been used to gather info about these topics (preliminary study heuristic evaluation with 3 experts (85% of the usability issues)).
Help with the qualitative

Age range not enough:
Everyone was between 20 and 25, so I didn't make a note of ages.

Conclusion
No correlation between previous experience and score, the game succeeded as the casual genre

Correlation between play through and score, for female not male lower multiplyer
Multiplyer being negative and positive caused confusion
