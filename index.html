		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Quantitative</h3>
			<p>In order to investigate my first 2 main objectives, I needed to get quantitative data on previous gaming experience, and scores over multiple plays. I decided to go for 3 play throughs so I could get data from a larger sample size of players.
			<p>The sample size was 27, with 14 male, and 13 female participants which is a fairly even split of genders. I also got testers from both the Games Academy (15) and the Academy of Music and Theatre Arts (12) in order to achieve a wider spread of previous gaming experience.</p>
			<p>I asked each participant to rate their previous gaming experience from 1 (lowest) to 5(highest). I also noted which participants looked at the instructions, and for the first game I wrote down how many keys were tried before the spacebar was pressed.</p>
			<p>I wrote down the score and multiplier of each player for each of the rounds.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Due to the game score not being shown at the end of each round, I had to watch every player and make a note myself instead of being able to hand out a survey. This meant that it took me longer to gather up a decent sample size, however I am happy with 27 since over 20 is considered enough for statistical significance<sup>1</sup>.</p>
			<p>For the same reason as above, my attention was mainly on the score, this meant there was less focus on observations so there were some things that users said that I was unable to note down.</p>
			<p>Screen capture could have solved both of these issues.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Qualitative</h3>
			<p>For my qualitative research I carried out semi structured interviews with 5 people (3 male, 2 female). The reason for 5 interviewees was to optimise my time<sup>1</sup> since the research was conducted in a short time frame.</p>
			<p>I let each person play the game 3 times without direction before questioning them. Since the game was short, each interview lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>I asked 3 main questions; "Did you have any issues with the single button controls?", "Did you find anything distracting or confusing about the UI?", and "Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?", and added extra questions based on observations or responses in order to gain a deeper insight.</p>
			<p>Qualitative data was also gathered through noting down what participants in the quantitative method said while they were playing, and observing their play style.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Ideally I would have like to film the interviews, however, when asked, none of the interviewees were comfortable with the filming. The lack of screen or voice recording was an oversight on my part and would've been a valuable tool in this research, by the time I had realised this the bulk of the research was done so this is something to bring into future research.</p>
			<p>In an attempt to save transcription time I was writing down the interview as it went, which slowed down the interview, hindered my engagement. Possible transcription errors may have occurred, since the end of sentences were from memory due to writing speed. This wouldn't have changed the core of the answers given, but nuances in the speech could have been missed. This was not worth the time save and it would've been better to use the recording equipment previously mentioned so I can be fully engaged with the user.</p>
			<p>The questions I asked interviewees was a bit broad since I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for in the game. If I were to conduct this research again, I would start off with a preliminary heuristic evaluation with 4 experts in order to determine around 75% of usability issues while maintaining an optimum cost to benefit ratio<sup>2</sup>. With this information I could form specific questions for the structured interview surrounding the usability issues found in order to explore solutions to the main problems.</p>

			<h3>Relationship between plays and score and multipliers:</h3>

				<div>
					<h3>"I expect the player to be able to improve at the game and obtain higher scores and multipliers"</h3>
					<p>
						To explore this relationship, I will total up the scores from all the players for each of the rounds for males, females, and overall. I will then plot out the score against the number of plays.
					</p>
					<p>
						The multiplier is gained by picking up a tea cup which both damages you and increases your multiplier, which should see interesting behaviour as to whether players thought it was balanced enough to take the negative effects.

					Overall, there was an improvement in score over time showing that players improve with playing. However, for males alone, there was actually a dip in score after the second turn. This correlates with the multiplier score in the graph to the right.
				</p>
				</p>
					I was not expecting the result that came from the multiplier. Overall, there was a drop in the multiplier with a similar discrepancy between male and female participants to the score. Although females tended to continue getting higher multipliers, the multiplier increased less in comparison to the score. So players seem to be avoiding the multiplier once they are aware of its negative effects.

							<h3>Exploring why the multiplier went down over time for males</h3>
							<p>A possible reason for males avoiding the multiplier more is because only (7/14, 50%) of males read the instructions compared to (9/13, 69.2%) of females. This lead me to investigate further and plot the mean multiplier over time for those who read the instructions, and those who didn't. The results for which are very interesting.</p>
							<p>It seems that the multiplier was avoided more after the second go by those who didn't read the instructions, and the multiplier score actually went up for those who did.</p>
							<p>This means that players are weighing up the benefits of the tea cup, and realising the long term benefits of collecting it.</p>
							<p>One interviewee talked about the tea cup and said "I saw it damaging me so I avoided it." and when asked whether the damage wasn't worth the multiplier they said "I didn’t know that the tea was the multiplier, I thought it was bad", which shows confusion surrounding the tea cup and the multiplier. This was backed up by 2 other interviewees, one saying "The cups are confusing, I don’t know what they do" and the other saying "I couldn’t remember which mug was good and which was bad so I avoided them both.". 
							<p>The final quote was from an interviewee who actually clicked on the instructions twice explaining "I forgot them straight after reading them", so ability to memorise items could be a factor, however I didn't measure this so I unable to explore this hypothesis with this evaluation.</p>

				</div>
				<p>The multiplier to score graph shows a medium positive correlation between the 2 which would suggest that the score dropped for males because they didn't read the instructions, however the score over time for those who read instructions and those who didn't would suggest otherwise.</p>
				<p>From the graph on the right, you can see that, although those who read the instructions scored higher, the increase in score for those who didn't read the instructions after round 2 was higher that for those who did.</p>
				<p>This suggests that it was either a coincidence or an undetermined link which caused male scores to drop after round 2.</p>

					<h3>"Since the game is casual in nature, I expect the correlation between previous gaming experience and score to be weak"</h3>

				<p>The trend lines shows no correlation between previous gaming experience and mean score achieved, and also between highest score achieved and previous gaming experience. This shows that score is not affected by previous gaming experience, so this is a casual game.</p>
				<p>The control scheme was noted as "simplistic" by and interviewee, and 27/27 play testers hit the spacebar within the first 3 tries at guessing controls. This backs up that the game is easy and intuitive to pick up.</p>
				<p>One concern could be that the 1 button could be too simplistic. 2/5 interviewees liked the challenge, one saying "I liked how you could flip around to avoid things", and the other saying the restriction "made it harder but that’s not really a bad thing", however 3/5 wanted some kind of extra control, the first complaing that "Sometimes the bad things would be in the middle and I couldn’t avoid them", the second saying "Sometimes I couldn’t dodge things" and wanting to "have more control over what you collect", and the final mentioning "there were some things that I couldn’t avoid if I tried".</p>
				<p>Of these interviewees, the consensus was being able to "duck" or "fall over" or to have "have other ways of dodging the items", which is backed up by 5/15 of the players who didn't read the instructions going for arrow keys.</p>

		<h2>Further Analysis of Structured Interviews</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Did you have any issues with the single button controls?</h3>
			<p>This question was touched upon above when referring to simplistic controls and whether or not they were considered too simplistic. With 2/5 interviewees liking the simplicity and the challenge that came with the restriction and 3/5 wanting more control, it is difficult to draw a conclusion from this.</p>
			<p>Having said this, and also mentioning that 5/15 players who didn't look at the instructions went for arrow keys, this leaves 10/15 players who were content with just jumping and didn't try to move about.</p>
			<p>In addition, when asked "Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?" none of the interviewees brought up the controls again, so it wasn't enough of an issue to bring up again. There was a far more apparent response over this.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Did you find anything distracting or confusing about the UI?</h3>
			<p>Many of the UI elements were touched upon as being ignored or not noticed, the first interviewee mentioned the purely for fun text at the bottom "I saw some text at the bottom, but I don’t know what it said because I couldn’t read it." and another, when asked about it said "I didn’t notice that" which suggests some distraction from the game, with no positive effect on experience.</p>
			<p>In the more important UI elements of the health, score and multiplier, there was inconsistency with what the interviewees noticed, with 4/5 of them missing important information. One questioned "There was health?" when it was mentioned, as well as explaining "I didn’t know there was a score, I was just looking at the items.", when asked if they were looking at that instead. Another interviewee said "I didn’t have time to look at the score or multiplier, I was looking at my health."</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?</h3>
			<p>This question, although broad, generated the most consensus amongst the interviewees, with 4/5 saying in some form that they would like to be able to see their score after the game has finished, with one complaining "There wasn’t really an incentive because you don’t know your score so there’s nothing to aim for." The fifth interviewee which didn't bring this up was the one who said "I didn't know there was a score" which backs up the need for that feedback when you aren't busy playing the game.</p>
			<p>Also from the fifth interviewee, it was suggested that "There should be more of a difference between good and bad things", with visual indicators on picking them up. This would mean that the 11/27 (40.7%) of players who didn't click on the instructions would also get a visual indicator of what was good and what was bad, as well as possibly subsiding the confusion over the mugs and the comments such as "I couldn’t remember which mug was good and which was bad so I avoided them both." and "I didn’t know that the tea was the multiplier, I thought it was bad".</p>
