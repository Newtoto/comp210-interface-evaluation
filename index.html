		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Quantitative</h3>
			<p>In order to investigate my first 2 main objectives, I needed to get quantitative data on previous gaming experience, and scores over multiple plays. I decided to go for 3 play throughs so I could get data from a larger sample size of players.
			<p>The sample size was 27, with 14 male, and 13 female participants. Testers were from both the Games Academy (15/27, 55.6%) and the Academy of Music and Theatre Arts (12/27, 44.4%) in order to achieve a wider spread of the amount of previous gaming experience.</p>
			<p>I asked each participant to rate their previous gaming experience from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). I also noted which participants looked at the instructions, and for the first game I wrote down how many keys were tried before the spacebar was pressed.</p>
			<p>I wrote down the score and multiplier of each player for each of the rounds.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Due to the game score not being shown at the end of each round, I had to watch every player and make a note myself instead of being able to hand out a survey. This meant that it took me longer to gather up a decent sample size, however I am happy with 27 since over 20 is considered enough for statistical significance<sup>1</sup>.</p>
			<p>For the same reason as above, my attention was mainly on the score, this meant there was less focus on observations so there were some things that users said that I was unable to note down.</p>
			<p>Screen capture could have solved both of these issues.</p>
			
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Qualitative</h3>
			<p>For my qualitative research I carried out semi structured interviews with 5 people (3 male, 2 female). The reason for 5 interviewees was to optimise my time<sup>1</sup> since the research was conducted in a short time frame.</p>
			<p>I let each person play the game 3 times without direction before questioning them. Since the game was short, each interview lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>I asked 3 main questions; "Did you have any issues with the single button controls?", "Did you find anything distracting or confusing about the UI?", and "Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?", and added extra questions based on observations and responses in order to gain a deeper insight.</p>
			<p>Qualitative data was also gathered through noting down what participants in the quantitative method said while they were playing, and observing their play style.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Ideally I would have liked to film the interviews, however, when asked, none of the interviewees were comfortable with the camera. The lack of screen or voice recording was an oversight on my part and would've been a valuable tool in this research, by the time I had realised this the bulk of the research was done so this is something to bring into future research.</p>
			<p>In an attempt to save transcription time I was writing down the interview as it went (shown below), which slowed down the interview, and hindered my engagement. Possible transcription errors may have occurred, since the end of sentences were from memory due to writing speed. This wouldn't have changed the core of the answers given, but nuances in the speech could have been missed. This was not worth the time save and it would've been better to use the recording equipment previously mentioned so I can be fully engaged with the user.</p>

			<video controls style = "width:100%; height:500px;" src = "video/UsabilityScreenCapTestRecording.mp4"></video> 
			<p>The questions I asked interviewees was a bit broad since I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for in the game. If I were to conduct this research again, I would start off with a preliminary heuristic evaluation with 4 experts in order to determine around 75% of usability issues while maintaining an optimum cost to benefit ratio<sup>2</sup>. With this information I could form specific questions for the structured interview surrounding the usability issues found in order to explore solutions to the main problems.</p>

					<h3>"I expect the player to be able to improve at the game and obtain higher scores and multipliers"</h3>
					<p>
						To explore this relationship, I will total up the scores and multipliers from each of the rounds for males, females, and both combined. I will then plot out these both against the number of plays.
					</p>
					<p>
						The multiplier is gained by picking up a tea cup which both damages you and increases your multiplier, which should generate interesting behaviour as to whether players thought it was balanced enough to take the negative effects.
					</p>

				<p>
					Overall, there was an improvement in score over time showing that players improve with playing. However, for males alone, there was actually a dip in score after the second turn. This correlates with the multiplier score in the graph to the right.
				</p>
				</p>
					I was not expecting the result that came from the multiplier, where there was a drop in the multiplier overall over time. Although females tended to continue getting higher multipliers, the multiplier increased less in comparison to the score. So players seem to be avoiding the multiplier once they are aware of its negative effects.

							<h3>Exploring why the multiplier went down over time for males</h3>
							<p>A possible reason for males avoiding the multiplier more is because only (7/14, 50%) of males read the instructions compared to (9/13, 69.2%) of females. This lead me to investigate further and plot the mean multiplier over time for those who read the instructions, and those who didn't. The results for which are on the left.</p>
							<p>It seems that the multiplier was avoided more after the second go by those who didn't read the instructions, and the multiplier score actually went up for those who did.</p>
							<p>This means that players are weighing up the benefits of the tea cup, and realising the long term benefits of collecting it.</p>
							<p>One interviewee talked about the tea cup and said "I saw it damaging me so I avoided it." and when asked whether the damage wasn't worth the multiplier they said "I didn’t know that the tea was the multiplier, I thought it was bad", which shows confusion surrounding the tea cup and the multiplier. This was backed up by 2 other interviewees, one saying "The cups are confusing, I don’t know what they do" and the other saying "I couldn’t remember which mug was good and which was bad so I avoided them both.". 
							<p>This final quote is from an interviewee who actually clicked on the instructions twice explaining "I forgot them straight after reading them", so ability to memorise items could be a factor, however I didn't measure this so I unable to explore this hypothesis with this research.</p>

				<h3>Exploring why male scores dropped after round 2</h3>
				<div style = "display:flex;">
					<div style = "flex: 1">
						<iframe style = "width:100%; height:387px; border:none" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-OmmdsvZ01JntII7pYeH1fETrKe1oOfzGhl8kirEu1Mw89EFrna1gTuNBqNm76bGQpzg7W6HIsN0d/pubchart?oid=1880312420&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>The multiplier to score graph shows a medium positive correlation between the 2 which would suggest that the score dropped for males because they didn't read the instructions, however the graph for score and reading instructions on the right would suggest otherwise.</p>
				<p>From the graph on the right, you can see that, although those who read the instructions scored higher, the increase in score for those who didn't read the instructions after round 2 was higher that for those who did.</p>
				<p>This suggests that it was either a coincidence or an undetermined link which caused male scores to drop after round 2.</p>

					<h3>"Since the game is casual in nature, I expect the correlation between previous gaming experience and score to be weak"</h3>
					<p>
						To explore this theory I will gather a graph for the average score in relation to previous gaming experience and the highest score achieved against previous gaming experience.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div style = "display:flex;">
					<div style = "flex: 1">
						<iframe style = "width:100%; height:387px; border:none" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-OmmdsvZ01JntII7pYeH1fETrKe1oOfzGhl8kirEu1Mw89EFrna1gTuNBqNm76bGQpzg7W6HIsN0d/pubchart?oid=711117353&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

				<p>The trend lines shows a small positive correlation to no correlation between previous gaming experience and mean score achieved, and also a small positive correlation to no correlation between highest score achieved and previous gaming experience. This shows that score is barely, if at all affected by previous gaming experience, therefore this is a casual game.</p>
				<p>The control scheme was noted as "simplistic" by and interviewee, and 27/27 play testers hit the spacebar within the first 3 tries at guessing controls. This backs up that the game is easy and intuitive to pick up.</p>
				<p>One concern could be that the 1 button could be too simplistic. 2/5 interviewees liked the challenge, one saying "I liked how you could flip around to avoid things", and the other saying the restriction "made it harder but that’s not really a bad thing", however 3/5 wanted some kind of extra control, the first complaing that "Sometimes the bad things would be in the middle and I couldn’t avoid them", the second saying "Sometimes I couldn’t dodge things" and wanting to "have more control over what you collect", and the final mentioning "there were some things that I couldn’t avoid if I tried".</p>
				<p>Of these interviewees, the consensus was being able to "duck" or "fall over" or to have "have other ways of dodging the items", which is backed up by 5/15 of the players who didn't read the instructions going for arrow keys.</p>

		<h2>Discussion: Further Analysis of Structured Interviews</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Did you have any issues with the single button controls?</h3>
			<p>This question was touched upon above when referring to simplistic controls and whether or not they were considered too simplistic. With 2/5 interviewees liking the simplicity and the challenge that came with the restriction and 3/5 wanting more control, it is difficult to draw a conclusion from this.</p>
			<p>Having said this, and also noting that 5/15 players who didn't look at the instructions went for arrow keys, this leaves 10/15 players who were content with just jumping and didn't try to move about.</p>
			<p>In addition, when asked "Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?" none of the interviewees brought up the controls, so it wasn't considered enough of an issue to mention again.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Did you find anything distracting or confusing about the UI?</h3>
			<p>Many of the UI elements were touched upon as being ignored or not noticed. The first interviewee mentioned the text at the bottom saying "I saw some text at the bottom, but I don’t know what it said because I couldn’t read it." and another, when asked about it said "I didn’t notice that" which suggests it caused some distraction from the more important game aspects, with no positive effect on experience.</p>
			<p>For the more important UI elements such as the health, score and multiplier, there was inconsistency with what the interviewees noticed, with 4/5 of them missing important information. One questioned "There was health?" when it was mentioned, as well as explaining "I didn’t know there was a score, I was just looking at the items.", when asked if they were looking at that instead. Another interviewee said "I didn’t have time to look at the score or multiplier, I was looking at my health."</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?</h3>
			<p>This question, although broad, generated the most consensus amongst the interviewees, with 4/5 saying in some form that they would like to be able to see their score after the game has finished, with one complaining "There wasn’t really an incentive because you don’t know your score so there’s nothing to aim for." The fifth interviewee which didn't bring this up was the one who said "I didn't know there was a score" which backs up the need for score feedback once the game is over.</p>
			<p>Also from the fifth interviewee, it was suggested that "There should be more of a difference between good and bad things", with visual indicators when picking them up. The players who didn't click on the instructions 11/27 (40.7%) would also benefit from this visual indicator of what was good and what was bad. This would possibly subside the confusion over the mugs expressed in comments such as "I couldn’t remember which mug was good and which was bad so I avoided them both." and "I didn’t know that the tea was the multiplier, I thought it was bad".</p>

<!- Conclusion ->
<section id = "conclusion">
	<div class="light">
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Main Usability Issues</h3>
			<p>Drawing from both the qualitative and quantitative research, the top usability issues are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>A lack of understanding for what specific items did. The cups were too similar, resulting in confusion.</li>
			<li>Many found it difficult to keep track of UI elements such as score, multiplier and health while they were playing.</li>
			<li>Players didn't know what their score was once they finished the game as it wasn't displayed.</li>
			<li>Players entered the game without reading the instructions 11/27 (40.7%) of the time and as a result didn't know the controls, or what items did.</li>
			<li>Some players felt restricted by the controls (3/5 interviewees), although others found it a welcome challenge (2/5 interviewees).</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Suggested Design Change</h3>
			<p>From the usablity issues found, the most prevalent and agreed upon issue is that there is no way to see the scores once the game was finished. This means that there is a lack of motivation to keep playing due to not having a goal, or feedback on how well you did.</p>
			<p>This issue also caused problems for me on the research side, requiring me to be present for all play tests, as well as having to focus most of my attention on logging scores. This means that fixing this issue would have a positive impact on not only user experience, but also the effectiveness of future usability research on this game.</p>
			<p>The specific change I am proposing is to have an end screen after death which displays the player's score, multiplier and a high score table of previous results. This would address the issue of not being able to see how well you've done, as well as giving more motivation to the player to do well and play the game again.</p>
