		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Quantitative</h3>
			<p>In order to investigate my first 2 main objectives, I needed to get quantitative data on previous gaming experience, and scores over multilple plays. I decided to go for 3 play throughs so I could get data from a larger sample size of players.
			<p>The sample size was 27, with 14 male, and 13 female participants which is a fairly even split of genders. I also got testers from both the Games Academy (15) and the Academy of Music and Theatre Arts (12) in order to achieve a wider spread of previous gaming experience.</p>
			<p>I asked each participant to rate their previous gaming experience from 1 (lowest) to 5(highest). I also noted which participants looked at the instructions, and for the first game I wrote down how many keys were tried before the space bar was pressed.</p>
			<p>I wrote down the score and muliplyer of each player for each of the rounds.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Due to the game score not being shown at the end of each round, I had to watch every player and make a note myself instead of being able to hand out a survey. This meant that it took me longer to gather up a decent sample size, however I am happy with 27 since over 20 is considered enough for statistical significance<sup>1</sup>.</p>
			<p>For the same reason as above, my attention was mainly on the score, this meant there was less focus on observations so there were some things that users said that I was unable to note down.</p>
			<p>Screen capture could have solved both of these issues.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "even">
			<h3>Qualitative</h3>
			<p>For my qualitative research I carried out semi structured interviewes with 5 people (3 male, 2 female). The reason for 5 interviewees was to optimise my time<sup>1</sup> since the research was conducted in a short time frame.</p>
			<p>I let each person play the game 3 times without direction before questioning them. Since the game was short, each interview lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.</p>
			<p>I asked 3 main questions; "Did you have any issues with the single button controls?", "Did you find anything distracting or confusing about the UI?", and "Is there anything that you think is missing from the game?", and added extra questions based on observations or responses in order to gain a deeper insight.</p>
			<p>Qualitative data was also gathered through noting down what participants in the quantitative method said while they were playing, and observing their playstyle.</p>
			<p>&nbsp</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Ideally I would have like to film the interviews, however, when asked, none of the interviewees were comfortable with the filming. The lack of screen or voice recording was an oversight on my part and would've been a valuble tool in this research, by the time I had realised this the bulk of the research was done so this is something to bring into future research.</p>
			<p>In an attempt to save transcription time I was writing down the interview as it went, which slowed down the interview, hindered my engagement. Possible transcription errors may have occurred, since the end of sentences were from memory due to writing speed. This wouldn't have changed the core of the answers given, but nuances in the speach could have been missed. This was not worth the time save and it would've been better to use the recording equipment previously mentioned so I can be fully engaged with the user.</p>
			<p>The questions I asked interviewees was a bit broad since I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for in the game. If I were to conduct this research again, I would start off with a preliminary heuristic evaluation with 4 experts in order to determine around 75% of usability issues while mainting an optimum cost to benefit ratio<sup>2</sup>. With this information I could form specific questions for the structured interview surrounding the usibility issues found in order to explore solutions to the main problems.</p>

	<h2>Results (Raw data spreadsheed in link below)</h2>
		<div class = "odd">
			<h3>Relationship between plays and score and multipliers:</h3>
			<div class = "">
				<div>
					<h3>"I expect the player to be able to improve at the game and obtain higher scores and multipliers"</h3>
					<p>
						To explore this relationship, I will total up the scores from all the players for each of the rounds for males, females, and overall. I will then plot out the score against the number of plays.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div style = "display:flex;">

						<iframe style = "width:100%; height:387px; border:none" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-OmmdsvZ01JntII7pYeH1fETrKe1oOfzGhl8kirEu1Mw89EFrna1gTuNBqNm76bGQpzg7W6HIsN0d/pubchart?oid=1662279650&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
						<p>Overall, there was an improvement in score over time showing that players improve with playing. However, for males alone, there was actually a dip in score after the second turn. This may be because more females (9/13, 69.2%) viewed the instructions than men (7/14, 50%).</p>
					</div>
					<div style = "flex: 1">
						<iframe style = "width:100%; height:387px; border:none" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT-OmmdsvZ01JntII7pYeH1fETrKe1oOfzGhl8kirEu1Mw89EFrna1gTuNBqNm76bGQpzg7W6HIsN0d/pubchart?oid=1350847393&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
						<p>I was not expecting the result that came from the multiplier. Overall, there was a drop in the multiplier with a similar discrepancy between male and female participants to the score. Although females tended to continue getting higher multipliers, the multiplier increased less in comparison to the score.</p>

			<h3>Relationship between previous experience and score:</h3>
			<div class = "">
				<div>
					<h3>"Since the game is casual in nature, I expect the correlation between previous gaming experience and score to be weak"</h3>
					<p>
						To explore this theory I will gather a graph for the average score in relation to previous gaming experience and the highest score achieved agaisnt previous gaming experience.

						<p>The trend line may suggest a weak corellation, however from the spread of points I'm going to say that there is no correlation between previous gaming experience and mean score achieved.</p>

						<p>This graph is very similar to the mean graph with also no correlation between highest score achieved and previous gaming experience.</p>
