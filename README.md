# VR Game Proposal
<p>I plan to make a vr rooftop sniping experience using camo netting and/or a board to simulate the feeling of the edge of a rooftop. There will also be a fan to mimic the wind on a rooftop.</p>
<p>I will investigate using the vive tracker to control the game with a more realistic gun.</p>
